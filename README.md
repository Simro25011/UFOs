# UFOs

## Purpose
We would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.
